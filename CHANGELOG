  * 0.3.0

Enhancements

  * store block information in `_block` attribute (Issue #89)
  * add parallel density class (Issue #8)
  * add `cdf` attribute to `pmda.rdf.InterRDF` for cumulative
    distribution function
  * deprecate `get_cdf` method in `pmda.rdf.InterRDF_s` and use
    `cdf` attribute instead

  * add timing for _conclude and _prepare (Issue #49)
  * add parallel particle-particle RDF calculation module pmda.rdf (Issue #41)
  * add readonly_attributes context manager to ParallelAnalysisBase
  * add parallel implementation of Leaflet Finder (Issue #47)
  * add parallel site-specific RDF calculation module pmda.rdf.InterRDF_s
    (Issue #60)

Fixes
  * stacking results failed with odd number of frames (Issue #58)

Changes
  * requires dask >= 0.18.0 and respects/requires globally setting of the dask
