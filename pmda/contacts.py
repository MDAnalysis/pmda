"""Native contacts analysis --- :mod:`pmda.contacts`
================================================================

This module contains classes to analyze native contacts *Q* over a
trajectory. Native contacts of a conformation are contacts that exist
in a reference structure and in the conformation. Contacts in the
reference structure are always defined as being closer then a distance
`radius`. The fraction of native contacts for a conformation can be
calculated in different ways. This module supports 3 different metrics
listed below, as well as custom metrics.

1. *Hard Cut*: To count as a contact the atoms *i* and *j* have to be at least
   as close as in the reference structure.

2. *Soft Cut*: The atom pair *i* and *j* is assigned based on a soft potential
   that is 1 if the distance is 0, 1/2 if the distance is the same as in
   the reference and 0 for large distances. For the exact definition of the
   potential and parameters have a look at function :func:`soft_cut_q`.

3. *Radius Cut*: To count as a contact the atoms *i* and *j* cannot be further
   apart than some distance `radius`.

The "fraction of native contacts" *Q(t)* is a number between 0 and 1 and
calculated as the total number of native contacts for a given time frame
divided by the total number of contacts in the reference structure.


Examples for contact analysis
-----------------------------

One-dimensional contact analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an example we analyze the opening ("unzipping") of salt bridges
when the AdK enzyme opens up; this is one of the example trajectories
in MDAnalysis. ::

    import MDAnalysis as mda
    from pmda import contacts
    from MDAnalysis.tests.datafiles import PSF,DCD
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    # example trajectory (transition of AdK from closed to open)
    u = mda.Universe(PSF,DCD)
    # crude definition of salt bridges as contacts between NH/NZ in ARG/LYS and
    # OE*/OD* in ASP/GLU. You might want to think a little bit harder about the
    # problem before using this for real work.
    sel_basic = "(resname ARG LYS) and (name NH* NZ)"
    sel_acidic = "(resname ASP GLU) and (name OE* OD*)"
    # reference groups (first frame of the trajectory, but you could also use a
    # separate PDB, eg crystal structure)
    acidic = u.select_atoms(sel_acidic)
    basic = u.select_atoms(sel_basic)
    # set up analysis of native contacts ("salt bridges"); salt bridges have a
    # distance <6 A
    ca1 = contacts.Contacts(mobiles=(acidic, basic),
                            refs=(acidic, basic),
                            radius=6.0)
    # analyze trajectory and perform analysis of "native contacts" Q
    ca1.run(n_jobs=-1)
    # print number of averave contacts
    average_contacts = np.mean(ca1.timeseries[:, 1])
    print('average contacts = {}'.format(average_contacts))
    # plot time series q(t)
    f, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(ca1.timeseries[:, 0], ca1.timeseries[:, 1])
    ax.set(xlabel='frame', ylabel='fraction of native contacts',
           title='Native Contacts, average = {:.2f}'.format(average_contacts))
    fig.show()


The first graph shows that when AdK opens, about 20% of the salt
bridges that existed in the closed state disappear when the enzyme
opens. They open in a step-wise fashion (made more clear by the movie
`AdK_zipper_cartoon.avi`_).

.. rubric:: Notes

Suggested cutoff distances for different simulations

* For all-atom simulations, cutoff = 4.5 Å
* For coarse-grained simulations, cutoff = 6.0 Å


Two-dimensional contact analysis (q1-q2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Analyze a single DIMS transition of AdK between its closed and open
conformation and plot the trajectory projected on q1-q2 [Franklin2007]_ ::


    import MDAnalysis as mda
    from pmda import contacts
    from MDAnalysisTests.datafiles import PSF, DCD
    u = mda.Universe(PSF, DCD)
    q1q2 = contacts.q1q2(u.select_atoms('name CA'), radius=8)
    q1q2.run()

    f, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=plt.figaspect(0.5))
    ax[0].plot(q1q2.timeseries[:, 0], q1q2.timeseries[:, 1], label='q1')
    ax[0].plot(q1q2.timeseries[:, 0], q1q2.timeseries[:, 2], label='q2')
    ax[0].legend(loc='best')
    ax[1].plot(q1q2.timeseries[:, 1], q1q2.timeseries[:, 2], '.-')
    f.show()

Compare the resulting pathway to the `MinActionPath result for AdK`_
[Franklin2007]_.

Writing your own contact analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :class:`Contacts` class has been designed to be extensible for your own
analysis. As an example we will analyze when the acidic and basic groups of AdK
are in contact which each other; this means that at least one of the contacts
formed in the reference is closer than 2.5 Å.

For this we define a new function to determine if any contact is closer than
2.5 Å; this function must implement the API prescribed by :class:`Contacts`::

    def is_any_closer(r, r0, dist=2.5):
        return np.any(r < dist)

The first two parameters `r` and `r0` are provided by :class:`Contacts` when it
calls :func:`is_any_closer` while the others can be passed as keyword args
using the `kwargs` parameter in :class:`Contacts`.

Next we are creating an instance of the :class:`Contacts` class and use the
:func:`is_any_closer` function as an argument to `method` and run the
analysis::

    # crude definition of salt bridges as contacts between NH/NZ in ARG/LYS and
    # OE*/OD* in ASP/GLU. You might want to think a little bit harder about the
    # problem before using this for real work.
    sel_basic = "(resname ARG LYS) and (name NH* NZ)"
    sel_acidic = "(resname ASP GLU) and (name OE* OD*)"

    # reference groups (first frame of the trajectory, but you could also use a
    # separate PDB, eg crystal structure)
    acidic = u.select_atoms(sel_acidic)
    basic = u.select_atoms(sel_basic)

    nc = contacts.Contacts(mobiles=(acidic, basic), refs=(acidic, basic)
                           method=is_any_closer,
                           kwargs={'dist': 2.5}).run(n_jobs=-1)

    bound = nc.timeseries[:, 1]
    frames = nc.timeseries[:, 0]

    f, ax = plt.subplots()

    ax.plot(frames, bound, '.')
    ax.set(xlabel='frame', ylabel='is Bound',
           ylim=(-0.1, 1.1))

    f.show()
