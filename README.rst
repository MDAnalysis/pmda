  PMDA - Parallel Molecular Dynamics Analysis
==============================================

|build| |cov| |PRwelcome| |zenodo|

:Release: |release|
:Date: |today|

Ready to use analysis and buildings blocks to write parallel analysis algorithms
using MDAnalysis_ with dask_.

.. warning::
   This project is **alpha software** and not API stable. It will and
   should rapidly evolve to test different approaches to implementing
   parallel analysis in a seamless and intuitive fashion.


For example, run a rmsd analysis on all available cores:

.. code:: python

   import MDAnalysis as mda
   from pmda import rms

   u = mda.Universe(top, traj)
   ref = mda.Universe(top, traj)

   rmsd_ana = rms.RMSD(u.atoms, ref.atoms).run(n_jobs=-1)

   print(rmsd_ana.rmsd)


By default PMDA use the multiprocessing scheduler of dask_. This is sufficient
if you want to run your simulation on a single machine. If your analysis takes
a very long time (>30 min) you can also spread it to several nodes using the
distributed_ scheduler. To do this you can pass a ``scheduler`` keyword
argument to the ``run`` method.

To write your own parallel algorithms you can subclass the
:class:`~pmda.parallel.ParallelAnalysisBase` class.
